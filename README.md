# Self-Watering-Duck


Welcome to the GitHub repository for our Arduino-based Plant Watering System. This project combines the powerful capabilities of the Arduino platform with the reliable tensiometer method for precise plant watering. With the integration of MQTT technology, you can remotely monitor and control your plant's water levels and automate watering schedules.

The code is written in Arduino programming language, making it accessible and easy to understand for beginners and experienced Arduino enthusiasts alike.
connect the reed switch between the ESP01 module, and battery.

Utilizing a tensiometer to measure soil moisture, this system ensures that your plants receive the optimal amount of water, preventing under or overwatering. By integrating IoT connectivity through platforms like Home Assistant, you can monitor and control the system from your smartphone or computer, even when you're away from home.
